Recently I’ve gotten to experience my first ever “Workout of the Day” in my new ICS314 class. Using a method called “Athletic Software Engineering,” students in this class were sat down with a time limit, and were asked to complete a moderately difficult exercise with the allotted time with a brand new language: Typescript. After completing the exercise, I left feeling good and productive, and see now how this method allows for students to prepare for real jobs, even if there are some things that I would change.

## TypeScript Reflection

Typescript is a robust language that allows for the development of scalable web applications, and an essential part of the web application development process. It is a very robust and flexible language, which makes it accessible to beginners whilst still allowing for very technical and sophisticated applications. I found Typescript very intuitive; it reminds me very much of Python in terms of its readability and flexibility in many scenarios. I say this in high praise, as Python is often looked at as the gold standard for accessible syntax.
Typescript’s top-to-bottom logic execution is amazing for students learning to debug and trace complex programs, as its code is much easier to follow and read without getting lost in convoluted syntax. Furthermore, the influence of C seen in the syntax makes Typescript very familiar to people who’ve learned C, further lowering the learning curve for this language and allowing people to focus more on the logic of the program being created rather than monotonous syntax.

The most important feature of Typescript, and the thing that separates it from Javascript is the introduction of static typing, which acts as a strong protective layer for the language. It catches errors at compile-time which would otherwise lead to annoying runtime failures. For a student, this language is a godsend for convenience and an invaluable teaching tool. It doesn’t just tell you why your code is wrong, but it also tells you why and often points directly to a data expectation error location. The introduction of static typing allows for students to better understand our errors and takes time away from tediously searching for errors.


## Athletic Software Engineering

Typescript was great to work with on this assignment, but the “Athletic Software Engineering” was where the productivity really came for me. Treating coding as this skill that can be competitive and honed-in on differed greatly from what I was used to; a more leisurely and ‘take-your-time’ approach seen in the assignments taken from previous terms. I found this approach highly effective in forcing a level of focus I often find myself lacking when studying. 
Software engineering in the real world is often never so leisurely. Deadlines and problem-solving is rampant, and so introducing time pressure often into assignments replicates real-world scenarios and often enhances performance for many who work better under pressure. The ticking clock puts one into a “flow state”, which eliminates distractions. This repetition builds muscle memory in the brain, and allows basic tasks to become second nature to save mental space for the more complex problems.


## In the context of relationships

Although I believe this exercise and teaching method to be effective for building efficiency within students, I do believe that there are points in this exercise that should be brought up. For one, I often found myself wishing for more creative freedom with my assignment. Although this was my first “Workout of the Day,” and hopefully future WODs take up on this, it would have been nice to come up with unique ways of solving the same problem, which is something you will often see in real-world applications and workplace scenarios. I do understand, however, the efficiency of giving a large class the same prompt with the same expected outcome. This probably makes it easier for graders and lecturers to analyze and grade more efficiently. The professional world often encourages developers to find the most efficient way to complete a task, and not just the conventional way. The rigid nature of this assignment takes away from the efficiencies that each student could possibly come up with.

Additionally, having students work together to complete an assignment would encourage a lot more non-linear thinking and allow for the development of students’ social skills and skills working as a team. Oftentimes seeing how other people approach the same problems we are can provide moments of clarity and insight that working alone cannot replicate fully.


## Conclusion

The introduction of TypeScript into the ICS curriculum at UH Manoa is an absolutely necessary and welcome evolution. As one of the most in-demand languages in the current job market, providing students with a strong fundamental understanding of it will vastly improve the marketability of all students undergoing this program. The addition of “Athletic Software Engineering” pushes us to solve complex problems under pressure, and refines our skills to mastery. This combo provides a solid foundation for the next level of software development for all students.
