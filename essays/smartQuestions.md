## The Power of Effective Communication

Learning how to ask proper questions and communicate effectively amongst your peers and the like will be one of the most important skills you will develop as a software engineer, and as a person in society altogether. The ability to get your thoughts and concerns across to another person effectively and directly will allow for a harmony within your team and within yourself that would not be possible if you were unable to communicate effectively. Good communication creates strong teams, even stronger projects, and a smooth workflow that could never be found in weak, uncommunicative teams.

## Raymond’s Precepts

Eric Raymond’s essay, [“How to Ask Questions the Smart Way,”](http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html) elaborates upon this idea and provides effective guidelines to create effective communication, particularly within the open-source software engineering community. Raymond essentially states that an expert’s time is a finite resource that should not be wasted when looking for guidance. If you respect an expert’s time and effort, they will be of great use and help to you. If you waste their time and energy, you will be ignored and ridiculed.

Raymond speaks on this idea that to ask a question is to request a favor from a person with more expertise on the subject at hand. To earn such a favor, one must prove that they are not a “lazy sponge,” as Raymond humorously states. Raymond expands upon this idea further by stating that one should present the problem at hand in a way that makes it easy for an expert to quickly understand and answer. Raymond speaks about not using unnecessary language, and to be precise, with clear language.

## The Smart Way

A clear example of everything Raymond speaks about in his essay is found in this question asked almost 14 years ago, which has garnered a staggering 27 thousand upvotes: [“Why is processing a sorted array faster than processing an unsorted array?”](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11227809/why-is-processing-a-sorted-array-faster-than-processing-an-unsorted-array) 

In this question, the original poster (OP) provides concise and self-contained C++ code that anyone could copy and run for themselves to see the speed difference. OP is specific with his data and provides exact timing data. OP has a clear goal in finding the reason as to why processing a sorted array is faster than processing an unsorted array. This question does everything right to make it easy for experts to answer, as Raymond would say. 

Because of how well the question was presented, it led to one of the most legendary and historically iconic responses in all of Stack Overflow: the answer given by user **Mysticial**. This user gave the infamous “railroad junction” analogy to explain branch prediction, which has garnered fame as one of the most helpful and effective answers given on the entire website.

## The "Not-So-Smart" Way

An example of a not-so-smart question would be something like **“HELP ME CODING ERRORS!!! URGENT!!”** This hypothetical user speaks with very general language and gives no context as to what his issue is or where his issue is coming from. Statements like, “it keeps giving me an error when i try to run it. i think its a bug in the compiler,” assume fault on other factors like the compiler and don’t specify any particular error anywhere in the question. 

This user also uploads an entire project file for others to look through instead of isolating the problem. This question violates many of the principles Raymond speaks about; as a result, such a thread would be downvoted heavily and quickly closed for lack of details, leaving the developer with no help at all.

## Personal Insights

Learning about Raymond’s principles in becoming and effective question-asker has given me a lot of newfound perspective in how I type up questions to my peers and mentors. Being precise in the questions I ask online or with my professors isn’t necessarily entirely about just getting an answer, but it also has implications on my reputation in the developer community around me. Becoming an effective communicator will greatly improve my workflow and the workflow of others.
